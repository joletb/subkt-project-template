If you encounter any playback issues with a GJM release, please make sure you are using the most recent version of MPC and xysubfilter, or mpv.
It is highly recommended that you use mpv.
Please note that there may be minor rendering differences between MPC/xysubfilter and mpv. 

If you wish to report any other general issues with a GJM release, please reach out to us using our website or our Discord server (both linked above) as we are no longer checking torrent comment sections.
  
Enjoy the release!
